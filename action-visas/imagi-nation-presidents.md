The IMAGI-NATION Presidents VISA is for 12-30 year olds who have been systemically pushed outside the margins. What we define as outside the margins is twofold, historically marginalised by societal design - eg. Anyone that wasn’t inside the castle. And then for young people born today we acknowledge that even if you’re born into the castle, the climate change reality won’t discriminate. So it’s all young people that can move into this role.

The role of the IMAGI-NATION President is to re-establish custodial economies.

We know a couple of things - that custodianship is about human beings realising that our role is to be in between nature, a shepherd, a guide, a being that works in relation to everything and helps maintain the balance of life. A custodian sees the intelligence of nature, and lives and learns with and from nature. A custodian knows that knowledge is not theirs, that they were born from nature, that they will return to nature and that all is in relation.

Our economic models do not centre the custodial relation, but they can. 1M young people as IMAGI-NATION Presidents have the opportunity to re-establish custodial economies and integrate them with the current economic models we have.

The first step is to move human beings’ attention to key species and water ways, and nature ecosystems in each region, and then to create design models to have the time in relation to nature. Then, after this, as Presidents we have to work out how to move the money, if we can’t move the \$$ to be in relation with nature, rather than  extracting from nature, then no amount of protest will move us. We have to unlock a nature-centred economy.

The IMAGI-NATION Presidents - this is your challenge, and across 1M of you, you will seed the micro and macro economic futures for life on earth.

The accreditation journey will measure:

* ## People you moved to nature
* ## Time in nature accumulated
* $ moved to nature
* Sharing openly the design and process

Here’s a video from one of Our Professors on The Presidents to help with further illumination.
