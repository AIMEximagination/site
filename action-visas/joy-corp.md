JOY Corps are a pathway for any organisation ( government, private, councils, small to global businesses) to find a pathway to unlocking imagination, custodianship and mentoring intelligence, at the highest level, for their organisation and all those they are in relation with.

In an age where automation is coming down the mountain at unprecedented speeds, there is no question that one of the few remaining human intelligence forms that can’t be automated is an original idea! The power of imagination - this doesn’t come without practice and discipline, without being efficient with our planning of time and creating space for imagination muscles to repair and regrow in adulthood.

Beyond imagination, we are faced with a significant macro tilt where how we currently organise ourselves as a species excludes nature. We aren’t in relation to everything, and that’s why our model of economics and our pathways to measuring success are out of sync with reality. Being in relation to nature and finding a path to a healthier, integrated custodianship journey for all beings that each organisation relates to, gives us a chance to find a more joyful, integrated reporting journey and road to future success.

Being in relation to each other and activating our offices and home offices to get our people at work to reach across the tracks to the world’s most marginalised kids, is how we create connection nodes for the intelligence currrently excluded from our mainstream organisations. These mainstream organisations can be  enhanced by the intelligence outside the margins.

The Joy Corp Criteria that organisations must reach to become accredited are below.And here’s a video from one of our Professors explaining Joy Corp.

**INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE SYSTEMS LABS (IKSL) || # VISAS Available over IMAGI-NATION Lifespan = 1000 (2032 - 45 Labs (AIME Death date and end of IMAGI-NATION?) || Number Open now 25 (2024 - 5 Labs?). Apply now or join wait list and view the 10-year release of VISAS as we grow in relation.**

IKSL is a pathway for Indigenous systems thinkers and knowledge holders to be able to come to the start of the design queue and trade across the systems design of all of life on Earth. As the oldest continuous human thinking and design labs on Earth, the IKSL network will help bring the world of organisations to trade with Indigenous people at the start of the systems design experience, to look at strategy, through to impact across all fields of enquiry.

The movement to 1000 Indigenous knowledge systems labs on land, creating a decentralised global lab for humanity to return to relations with the land and have a portal to re-establish intelligent connections with other species is necessary for us to find the pathway we need to re-imagine and design healthier organisations that are in relation with all organisms.

The Knowledge Labs accreditation works in two fields.

The first is about knowledge practice and the capacity to trade at a global systems’ level. Our governance support of the first Indigenous knowledge systems labs out of Deakin University will support the governance decisions around who is ready, and we already know those who have the knowledge and those who are in apprentice development pathways.

We need our Elders, our deep knowledge holders, to fuse with our younger ones and create a collective that can move.

The governance model suggested for labs is a generational intersection of 5 different Indigenous thinkers to be the custodians of each lab.The suggested cadence to allow for national reach for each nation is to internally meet on the last Friday of each week on the phone or if internet provides via video call for a Labs session.

The podcast model is then suggested as a pathway to publish external usall thinking.

To form a fully functional global trading Lab the following is what we’ll be looking to help support to happen and to shape. Each Lab to:

1. Have their own land.
2. Have 20 national/local/global leaders attend systems change residencies twice a year - each residency position costed at 10K per person, bringing in 400K revenue for each lab per year.
3. Host a ticketed returning festival for 20-200 local people for 2-3 days per year to return to the land.
4. Have temporary housing options for landlessness support.
5. Develop a Youth Mentoring model for developing further custodial economic work.
6. Measure the health and intelligence of the land in sync with the 1000 other labs to create a global case study for healthy land in relations and the processes needed for us to return to custodial practices.
7. Be supported with Knowledge publishing with an Other Others syndicated Official Podcast.
8. Develop Systems Design Case studies working out with local, national and global leaders to shape systems solutions that can scale.
9. To contribution other knowledge to the global lexicon in KOLAB
