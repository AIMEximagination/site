# IMAGI-NATION - GRP (Gross Relational Potential) $1 Trillion +

Welcome to IMAGI-NATION a digital nation that is focused on alleviating inequity for human kind and all other species by turbocharging the 6000 people/entities we believe after 20 years of in the field research can be the headwater to shift the health of life on earth.

The 6000 entities we have identified have a collective impact reach of at least 32 million people.

We focus on the entities that can impact 10000 people over the course of a lifetime (60 years), and then we help them deepen the depth of their impact so the impact can increase to reach to 100K people and deepen relations with nature.

AIME has founded IMAGI-NATION and one measurement of our early mentoring work valued our return to Aus economy at $1.1 Billion, the JOY Corp model we have created as a pathway to relational health and wealth for organisations will see 1000 Joy Corps apply the first iteration of the AIME Mentoring model as one of 70+ activations, including creating nature funds, a peace index, kindness economics and other measurement systems which sit in the non financial at this current time. The potential value of the mentoring component alone for JOY Corps could see $1 Trillion returned to the global economy relationally. Without any further impact measurement.

We have valued that each of the 6000 entities impact could after their time in IMAGI-NATION see an increase of 10K worth of value to each national economy. **LOOK AT THOMAS Mathematics to 10 Quntillion USD.** \[ADD In a nutshell, this is using Metcalfe’s law, assumptions on the total network built by IMAGI-NATION and assumption of the value creation per person in the network through the network - assumptions that lead to 10QN: 32.000.000 people in the network across 10 years + 10K USD value creation per person]

In terms of potential market value that lies ahead there is a minimum $750 billion nature based marketplace that has yet to be unlocked, and the R\&D value of the 6000 entities looking to unlock custodial economies, centre the design depth and quality is worth at least $1 Billion of that share with the 1000 Joy Corps, 1000 Indigenous Knowledge labs working on solving the nature economy pathway as the labs consulting to leaders across the earth - it’s more likely that the potential market share is some accusation of all the GDP around the world, that showcases the investment in the move to well being measurements.

When we look at governments we may ask what is the R\&D value of securing a parallel measurement system to GDP that includes JOY, kindness, nature, peace, would it count in around 1% worth of all GDP globally? Say total GDP is around 88 Billion, a further 1 Billion to well being score?

And then if we look to deep entrenched inequity, in areas outside the margins what can we learn from death, from magic, from returning to relations with the water, from the power of the sun, what is the total value of unlocking energy for all of human life?

In the toolshed what is the value of a knowledge text passed on? Of 100 texts that pass on deep long knowledge? The IP of IMAGI-NATION and code all open sourced? What is the value of 1000s of years of knowledge translated into IMAGINE Film? The value of the Professors bringing mentors into every home? OF the mentor app providing a pathway for all citizens to be trained as mentors?

The network values the action, and we focus on the relation between each actor, we believe one unlikely connection can change the world, that it creates imagination, and when harnessed with a kinship system and growth across a UNCx5 we can see a force multiplier that moves at a depth of relational quality that adds another dimension to the metcalf theory whereby we activate kinship mapping models in the internet with UNCx5 growth fusion. We then map the health of the network the focused actors to a limit of the number of faces we can know as per Dunbar research and then watch the river run from there.

Then what may be the potential of all of this in IMAGI-NATION, of our collective imagination, what price may we put on this? Maybe time will tell, maybe we will never be able to measure it.

With value of GRP (Gross Relational Potential) of over trillions of $, we believe after 20 years of evidence based research that we are well placed to help humanity unlock it’s potential and economic prosperity in relation to nature not abstracted from it.
