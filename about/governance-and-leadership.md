# Governance & Leadership

IMAGI-NATION is led by AIME which is a global organisation to alleviate inequity.

The responsibility of the design, implementation, action, impact ultimately rests on AIME's shoulders and the following ways are how the governance share of intelligence and responsibility is organised and distributed.

AIME is led by founder and CEO

(insert BIO)

Formally there are two boards that the CEO reports to, the AIME Global Board and AIME US Boards which are responsible for the financial, well being, health of IMAGI-NATION.

Other parties that have invested in the outcomes of IMAGI-NATION and help in a kinship model of governance are the following.

Custodians - we have up to 100 Custodian VISA positions for that lead networks of networks to shepherd the action, outcomes and quality of IMAGI-NATION - some of the current custodians include [@Sam Refshauge](mailto:sr@aimementoring.com) let's confirm three.

IMAGI-NATION is working towards unlocking universal imagination, mentoring and custodianship for all of human kind. To activate the richest source of intelligence across these fields we have activated circles and guides that can help all the way from design through to impact and back around in positive feedback loops.

Across the imagination, custodianship and mentoring our guides are:

* Imagination - Imagination Circle founded in (insert date) between AIME and Learning Planet featuring (X number) of organisations working to centre imagination in every classroom
* Custodianship - the Indigenous KNowledge Systems Labs out of Deakin Uni features (insert names) and our founder and CEO who meets the group weekly for guidance on design and intelligence.
* Mentoring - AIME has a mentors in residence program that has included esteemed leaders from around the world, this is activated twice a year for 15 leaders in the organisation. In 2023 Jacqueline Twillie in her role as AIME Co-CEO (Now AIME US CEO) engaged a womens coalition across 20 cities to imagine a healthier future for human kind, this circle is another source of guidance and intelligence and action for IMAGI-NATION.

Our north star in terms of success is to crack the code of returning $ and our behaviour to centring nature - the nature fund helps drive. And our intentional death is a governance play to move us openly towards sharing the knowledge, tools and acknowledging we are all in relation and to work to leave space for those to pick up the notes.
