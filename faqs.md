<summary>Can Passports then be traded in existing economies?</summary>

The answer is yes.  Your passport is just like any CV. This is real action and knowledge that people have acquired. We will also be working with trading partners in established mainstream economies like Festivals and accommodation providers to recognise the accreditation work and hoodie tokens on their platforms so this doesn’t work as an abstracted economy. Furthermore, we’ll be working with new Web 3 economies to see the value move into the different pathways and the tokens be recognised for trade.

<summary>How does IMAGI-NATION work?</summary>

Each VISA Holder applies for their different category of engagement. After this, they are brought in via a ceremony into IMAGI-NATION which sees them complete:

1. Relational Default settings survey
2. Relational mapping, to map to 5-15 key relations
3. Connection to mentor
4. Connection to core UNCx5 Group
5. Activate Passport

The accreditation journey is all linked to the Passport, and the coinage is a digital Hoodie, and in some cases the digital hoodie unlocks physical hoodies and other opportunities.

The way to unlock Hoodies is to:

1. Learn
2. Relate
3. Do

The device inside IMAGI-NATION for redeeming hoodies are:

* River Runs (learning modules)
* Accreditation submissions

At the end of the accreditation journey as a ceremony in to the next chapter, VISA holders complete the default settings to see the movement in relations, and then, if successfully accredited, receive access to trade for jobs, opportunities, knowledge, experiences in the Meeting Place for the lifecycle of IMAGI-NATION, and all accredited VISA holders gain a forever generational network access key to the IMAGI-NATION Directory for the club of unlikely connections to live on forever as a series of custodianship, mentoring, imagination embassies around the world, all in relation.
