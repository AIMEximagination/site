Welcome the the VISA Office!

This is the home base for action VISAs, to create deep relational action that can shift the face of inequity.

The VISAs are for a 12 month period. All VISA holders are linked in an Unlikely Connections x 5 (UNCx5) group and each group has a mentor. This is the governance model for knowledge transfer, intelligence, and to re-create a network nucleus for those outside the margins with those inside.

A VISA gives you access to IMAGI-NATION to then do the action, learning, and relational work to earn the accreditation. Accreditation happens throughout the year with challenges to unlock Hoodies and add them to a VISA Holder’s PASSPORT. The Passport is the reputational hack, a modern CV, which then, once accreditation is earned, will give each VISA holder the chance to trade for jobs, opportunities and exchanges of knowledge in the MEETING PLACE.

Each VISA holder that achieves successful accreditation will gain a lifetime access to IMAGI-NATION. All successful VISA holders will also gain forever access to the IMAGI-NATION Directory - this directory will live on once IMAGI-NATION dies (IMAGI-NATION’s death date is set to 10 years after it was opened). The directory will be passed down as a generational network hack, to provide a key to network equity and health across the world.

The application process is to firstly submit the outlined material and this is then followed by  an interview stage. If selected from this, the journey begins.

IMAGI-NATION is not attempting to grab more of your limited time. It’shoping to free it and enhance it. The only locked time commitment is once a month we gather and sit in our Unlikely Connections Circles. This monthly check in is a chance to reflect on the work we’ve done, to gather around an idea, to make and take space for our UNCx5 relations to deepen.During the month you’ll have access to contact each UNCx5 member via a chat group on your device, and then do the action work and the accreditation and learning work in IMAGI-NATION at the time that suits you.

Each VISA Holder that is successful in accreditation will unlock:

* their own physical Hoodie
* Their passport will be granted with access to the Meeting Place

Outstanding VISA contributions to alleviating inequity will gain access to:

* Flights and Accommodation to STORY experiences in embassy with the IMAGI-NATION Embassy around the world.

If full accreditation is not obtained, these VISA holders will leave with knowledge, and their passport that they can trade on in Planet Earth for what they did achieve.
