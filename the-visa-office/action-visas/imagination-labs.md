For schools with a high proportion of marginalised students, with large proportions of Indigenous young people, schools that have programs coming to knock on the door to fix the problem of the kids, for these schools, we reckon it’s time to raise the bar.

How about we invite your school to trade in real time as a global imagination lab? We  invite you to investigate problems from around the world and solve them, not as theory, but in reality. We invite schools to create their own imagination classrooms, to connect with organisations inside and outside IMAGI-NATION and invite into investigation the biggest challenges that humanity is facing and to look to solve them, now - not in the future. We invite you to explore activating the whole school curriculum around a singular focus to solve eg. Power and how to power the human race in relation to all other species and not race the humans beyond our collective resources.

Schools that integrate imagination, custodianship and mentoring throughout their DNA, walk the pathway towards accreditation as an Imagination Lab.

Accreditation will include:

* Creation of an imagination classroom.
* Integration of mentor class.
* Integration of mentor training for all kids to become mentors.
* Creation of mentoring program internally and for high schools to have a bridge to local primary schools.
* Establishing of custodial micro economies within the school, rewarding the relationship with the intelligence of nature.
* Connection with government, industry, local and ideally global to the edge of the unlikely connection to create a partnership for the school to work as a lab on a gnarly problem that can’t be solved with our current intelligence.

Here’s one of our Professors explaining more context around the Imagination Labs.
