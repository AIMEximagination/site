# Systems Change Citizens

**Systems Change Citizens**

For people looking to shift their action from a line to a weave, from a singular body of work out of relation, to an integrated systems-wide approach. The main body of work for people working on systems change is to re-orient the mapping process and understand where in the map the work is, how it links to everyone and everything before and afterwards, and then within that context to understand whether to act or not, how to move or not, and the most effective role to play in relational context to solving the challenge that one is seeking to address.

This VISA type comes with their already established body of work with a desire to deepen their systems design and implementation capacity. The key thinking modules within IMAGI-NATION are focused on custodianship, mentoring and imagination and how they are all integrated. The systems change citizens will get the chance to map this theory with their own body of work, and the unlikely connections that are generated inside IMAGI-NATION will shift systems change citizens network capacity and intelligence.

The accreditation journey measures a final essay/film/documentation project that looks at how the theory and network experience has affected the outcomes and journey of the Systems Change citizen.

Hereâ€™s a video from one of our Professors adding more illumination to the Systems Change VISA journey.
