# Hoodie Economics Template

4 dominant measurements:

1. GRP
2. Hoodie = Action
3. Unlikely Connections
4. Tools/knowledge transfered

\= Value of Hoodie

Then maybe for Impact - Hoodies feed into Message Stick and that's impact. Maybe just 4 categories. The other 5 can be for external impact? Illumination? Context

Notes below for Hoodie Economic mailout vibes and template for deck and projects as moving.

Okay Hoodie Economics

Here’s what I think potentially we can measure and then weave into the message stick

The Hoodie Economics is the impact across all projects

One per action VISA

One per systems change citizen

One per tool

————

Maybe formula is something like this

1. GRP

\#GRP - Potential Market Value of Project

eg. Sea The Weed - 1M + IP - One coastline. x 100 Coastlines = 100M R\&D project

2. Hoodies & action

## Hoodie Economics

* Bought at $500
* Earned via organisations relational time by Shareholders 2 hours per month over 10 years x 20 people = 2040 hours - 12000 minutes returned to nature
* Kindness exchange - score the kindness
* $ Returned to coastline
* Crayweed reforestation growth % of project complete
*

3. Unlikely Connections powering project

## UNCx5 of project = 1 foundational UNCx5

## Ustwos - 1 (Brendo/Arthur)

4. Knowledge/Tools Developed

Value of Hoodies in total

{GRP + Hoodie Exchange value} + Unlikely Connections potential impact of network + Tools produced) / #Hoodies = Sea The Weed Hoodie Value

—————

Purchase one here 15 remaining

Becoming one of 20 shareholders - 15 remaining

Take the model to your coastline - One hoodie per custodian

Kindness exchange - gift your time, knowledge to the project
