# Dinosaur Trance

Hey Gang,

Amber ace to yarn. Here's the big picture vision on DINO [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXbw2zoOSbq1gIhrms5i2sM9PtDqATr68Q\_bp333mqA/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gXbw2zoOSbq1gIhrms5i2sM9PtDqATr68Q\_bp333mqA/edit) (its a bit out of date but gives a sense of vibe). Amber it will be you and Sar to rock this world together as an Ustwo and we'll jump in if helpful.

Theme of this year is WATER

[@Sarineh Garapetian](mailto:sg@aimementoring.com) please nail the production on this and editorial. Kabir over insights on design. Yol you work with Sar on research and plug in one of designers when needed on layout.

Amber would love to have you work on this from a design front end, then we drop the stories to you and then you populate layout. [@Sarineh Garapetian](mailto:sg@aimementoring.com) leads digital mailout on Wed.

[@Yolande Brown](mailto:ybr@aimementoring.com) [@Sarineh Garapetian](mailto:sg@aimementoring.com) we choose which tool we will republish with the gang on Monday. [@Benjamin Knight](mailto:bk@aimementoring.com) you work on pics archives and other design elements we've made already (eg. night in IMAGI-NATION).

Building on existing Wanderer template with more collage.

[@Yolande Brown](mailto:ybr@aimementoring.com) [@Kabir Dhanji](mailto:kd@aimementoring.com) [@Sarineh Garapetian](mailto:sg@aimementoring.com) I can't find the words I wrote on cut copy paste Dino so I'll have another go

What is this Magazine?

Editors Note

We won't create a new word for Dinosaur Trance. Everything we make will be a repeat of something that has already been made. We will encourage us to look backwards as a species. Because the knowledge we have is already here. The maps are already here. We have obsessed with ourselves. We have overused our word count. We have stuck ourselves in the human story. Not the earth story. We look from us out, not from the other species in. The first four pages features a conversation that I was deeply lucky to be a part of called Platypus Finance from the Other Others. It strikes me that the abstraction is not in looking from the Platypus lens at finance, but from looking at a coin to everything else.

We've had 20 years of making tools and knowledge and writing words, and we want to be mentors for the next 10 as we eye the death of AIME and IMAGI-NATION, the countdown is about to tip into 9 years remaining for us, we want to make sure we responsibly package up the knowledge shared with us into tools that live on for you and your children.

And so we make a 10 year magazine, 10 editions in total. We have the courage to paint the big story with a 10 year vision on the themes

1. Year 1 - Impact
2. Year 2 - Design
3. Year 3 - Big Story
4. Year 4 - Mentoring
5. Year 5 - Relational Economics
6. Year 6 - Imagination
7. Year 7 - Systems Change
8. Year 8 - Custodianship
9. Year 9 - Action
10. Year 10 - Tools

This year we introduce the Impact edition, looking at how we can measure impact, make sense of the maps, of the road ahead, the process for measuring what we cannot see, the space between and how we can find a way to shape a system that recognises that all impact is all related all the time, that we are all in relation.

This is page 0-4. For the AIME Friends we will be releasing each 4 pages of the magazine every week throughout the year. Consider it a degustation magazine. You'll be able to purchase the physical copy at any time before Nov 15 when we go to print to get you your copy in the new year.

Why Dinosaur Trance? We wanted to focus on reminding us all, that we gotta go back, way back to find the puzzle pieces we excluded when we made the castles and left almost everyone out and all the other species, 7 million of them, out of the puzzle of what we called life, of our economies, of our sight, of our relation, when we go back, we find the formulas for relation, when we activate the systemic design intelligence of our longest human labs, our Indigenous knowledge labs, then we can fuse the pathway with what we've got, from what we've had, to where we may go.

And if we go right back to the Dinosaurs, and even before, we may be able to wake ourselves outta this trance before we face our own extinction.

Dinosaur Trance is here.

Enjoy the knowledge
