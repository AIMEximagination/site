IMAGI-NATION is envisioned as a "digital nation" and "lightning laboratory for humankind" to apply and experiment with relational economics principles.&#x20;

It has three main delivery channels:

1. **Imagination** - A digital playground focused on finding 5,000 influential people from inside/outside the margins to create a relational economic ecosystem globally. It includes 100 system change projects with universal potential and 100 tools being developed.&#x20;
2. **Embassy** - Physical activations in cities/towns through initiatives like the Reserve Bank of Dreams, 10,000 Imagination Classrooms, uniting mentors through Mentor Magic, and reclaiming attention through pledge systems.&#x20;
3. **Tools** - Open-source tools accessible to all, including economics tools like Mentor App, Game of Life, Imagine Film, Professors, and 1 Million Presidents to re-establish custodial economies.&#x20;

IMAGI-NATION aims to unlock over $1 trillion worth of "planetary wealth" by connecting marginalized intelligence with those inside the margins.&#x20;

It explores concepts like Gross Relational Potential (GRP) as an alternative to GDP, energy matrix scores, re-establishing songlines, and optimal time within networks.&#x20;

<summary><strong>Zoom Recording with Jack</strong></summary>

I think if you want to pull out that image, I reckon that's the one that has text through the latest one. Oh, I think that's the last one. That one, I think, is, I think it explains all of the pieces and what, you know, we've been sense-making, trying to get our way to understand what imagination is. And I think then running them in parallel, either, you know, vertically or you could run them horizontally to see what... Design works more effectively. But I think you can fit in, you know, where we've been struggling is coming up through a tool or through an embassy piece or through one element of imagination. Yeah, so I just, you know, reading it out, like, aim addresses planetary inequity in a model that can impact billions of people and millions of other species by connecting the marginalised intelligence in relation with those inside the margins to unlock, to understand. And I think that's the key to this. I think the key to this is to unlock our untapped network potential. The model of networking applied in AIM's network, that's not right, but anyway, is to follow an unlikely connections design mechanism to connect you to what you don't know and who you don't know, to move away from affirming our biases. There is a specific nucleus effect that allows us to connect to what we don't know and who we don't know. And it's already there. So, that's the core of the AIMs network, to be to have a deeper factor of velocity of impact or something around a sense like that, where we gather people in nucleuses of five powered by unlikely connections across different areas and spaces. And all with those that are action based looking to, you know, at the head water or the tip of the scale or whatever the start of the design to that have the ability to influence the way um we shift what we value and how we move so something in that sort of essence of writing has been around um the following are the three delivery channels um for this network of unlikely connections um to unlock the the missing intelligence that we have as a species and the first one is imagination a digital nation um to be a lightning laboratory for humankind um imagination focuses on three distinct playgrounds um finding 5 000 uh people that can influence 10 000 people each um from inside we are coming from inside or outside the margins uh to move the way we uh operate economically to create a relational economic um ecosystem globally with 5 000 entities embassies for exchange it'll be a better word than embassy but that's sort of like okay cool so um that's you know a couple of bullet points 100 systems change leaders with universal potential to change like with projects that can alleviate inequity um universally that are then supported and turbocharged um through a residency program and then a hundred tools that are developed inside imagination and then maybe the last bullet point is um imagination provides a container uh for us to analyze um like a laboratory for us to analyze how we develop networks um from internet networks through to government networks councils organizations and we experiment with um impact measurement pathways and design including to help us innovate how we revolutionize measuring impact and some of the things we are looking at inside are an alternative to gdp in the form of grp or gri um we're looking at different energy matrix scores um to look at the health to move away from thumbs ups or love hearts um to something that is based in more depth um and and anchored to something we're looking at how you know all of imagination's ip can go back to nature and we can re-establish songlines um we're exploring how we can re-establish songlines and we're exploring how we can re-establish songlines and we're exploring how we can re-establish songlines and we're exploring the impact of um of how much time is needed inside a network and how much time is not needed um and you know yeah i think like part of so that that's sort of that bundle so okay that kind of gives us those bullet points and an embassy um there's this guy who founded the euro who wanted to set up a reserve bank of dreams he was thomas's mentor he was a member of the euro who wanted to set up a reserve bank of dreams he was thomas's mentor he was a member of the um that's what the thousand year dream project is so you'd have an embassy you know um the aim team is out around the world in embassy and it can just be in in embassy we don't have to say as an imagination embassy like that's where i think it's been complicated stumbling around it but we're out in embassy you know and you can have imagination and aim both on the logos we're embassy of both um yeah but we're out in embassy to unlock imagination custodianship and mentoring like that's hidden we don't even need to say that but the projects we're working on in embassy are you know to activate cities and towns through big story um and locations already activated include um montreux paris like a learning planet like you know the forest of imagination um waga city council like you know or waga you know we could just list them there's the reserve bank of dreams um creating a reserve bank of dreams for humanity um with a thousand year dream project which is set to go live in 2024 um there's building 10 000 imagination classrooms um and then there's uniting a world of mentors uh through mental magic as like four embassy playgrounds and then the fifth might be um reclaiming our attention like and through a pledge system reminding us giving us an excuse to shift our attention um to nature to kindness to magic to death and you have the four pledges there and then they're all just embassy offers you know for us yeah and then in tools um you know accessible by all of humankind forever um you know open source and like and notes that other people can pick up and build on in development you know 20 like 20 economics you have as a first tool like released mentor app like you know in development to be released this year mentor class in development um for a 2025 release game of life in development for 2025 release um imagine film in development for 2025 release and professors in development for 2025 release and i'd put one million presidents um to re-establish custodial economies i just have that as a tool um to go we're just going to move that around um and then um you know we're going to have over there and so that's something we'll do in development so you incubate the thousand and you can still deliver on you know at scale yeah having this marketplace re-establishing custodial economies that pretty much covers everything um in embassy maybe you'd have like um like uh just look at the guardians of the earth piece but you might just put a number there as a working piece which might be um you know yeah i'm just trying to think about the like the elements of the lab stuff and joy corp and all those things doesn't necessarily come through in those bullet points like there's a way we could illuminate them in the imagination so it's not just you know you might have sub sub like category one liners but let's just say back in imagination you've got you know the indigenous society you've got the indigenous society you've got the indigenous society you've got the indigenous knowledge systems labs like a decentralized um global on land mit shepherded by indigenous people around the world um yeah as a residency pathway for global leaders to activate custodial knowledge systems and economies you know joy corp a pathway to integrate these seven missing pieces from our impact scorecard which is not measured in gdp or any of our balance sheets yeah imagination presidents to establish custodial economies um and give us micro case studies from young people and move the generation of climate um protest to economic stimulation systems change lens you know to take isolated um work and and connect it and so we can see an amplification effect when we make puzzles imagination labs to activate schools to be outside the margins to go from a problem to be fixed to the solution yeah um and you kind of just have those as the you know the the 5 000 sub groups in those bullet points so people can see that really clearly and i think in um yeah in embassy i would put nature like re-establishing like the health of our relationship with nature um and maybe that can just be a tool that's in development as a nature fund just put in the tool and that's what that's where nature fund sits in the tool with um with guardians yeah and i think that gives us everything and then the last sentence you know aim can unlock over one trillion dollars worth of planetary wealth for humankind um and then you have the logic that's the one page that's where you land on the website yeah and you just have that as a front page yeah and then and then the menus are imagination um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um um yeah and you know a partner with us like blah blah but just in terms of the three things like we can work out the other more standard things but just just to get the architecture right and then the impact should be how we're going in imagination across those areas and you can measure participants if we know all the inputs in there but in all that writing that i just did on grp like that can sit yep in paid imagination and narendra has just done some extra stuff looking at the velocity of UNC5 and just if you do some iconography with it you did and it's positioned in that last bullet point of this is how we're exploring in this container of imagination providing a network research lab so you know we've built it to to to operate with a as a nation's like with a nation methodology you know we've built it with visas we've built it um with a reserve bank which we've you know created as a reserve bank to stimulate service like just to kind of go through some of these big thinking things which are invisible yeah so someone can see wow this is a live r\&d research lab for us on how we can shift government pieces get in touch with a government that wants to apply some of the theories or work with us to you know develop um research and understand what's going on inside here and how this could be applied to cities towns councils like that the real target market becomes them for imagination like this is government r\&d you know not not to build a nation state to run away from government destroy government but actually to make government better and organizations healthier you know joy corpse the r\&d for all organizations like every section inside imagination is like trying to accelerate the research and development that key entities around the world we're not trying to build a thousand pure imagination schools we're doing this so there can be every school can be an imagination school yeah we're not trying to create a thousand brilliant joy cops it's so that every organization will be a joy cop and so everything is a call to action that that covers the um the question of like access accessibility this is an elite this is so we can prove it and share it these guys are actually the opposite of being elite they're coming in and doing the experimentation putting their reputation on the line first yeah and then you can apply it yeah so if you want to do it you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do itよ want to be connected to the research you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do it you can do it ec to the research et cetera a beer ecosystem partner um then i think that that's not said no you can see than i think that that's not said no you can see how that's not longer than scrolling down a couple of key areas of just like oh the five 000 this is how this is a theory of change with this it's a waterfall effect the embassy you know has to come to a city book us come to reserve bank of dreams like yeah you know because cause me a town um we're in locations around here we can run a dreams workshop with you but if you decide you want to be head over to know about geordie awick get caught something takes over to georgie review so that lets you know we could do that we could get up any time we're in locations around here we can run a dreams workshop this year and we can just give our team the dreams mentor class that they can run they don't have to have a vehicle yeah and then imagination classrooms plus dreams mentor class you know this becomes our embassy working schools yeah cool yeah like a reverse engineered heaps better version of the cluster that is advisory of places like pwc and all those places it's like rather than spending millions of dollars to engage a broken system like a historical broken system what's the what's what's leveraging the new way of thinking through unlikely connections intelligence and that's what i'm trying to do yeah you could sell an insight you know we could we don't have to but you could i mean you could sell an insight magazine just for industry totally yeah and just say we can share for you guys if people don't want to subscribe that's that's sort of something you can you know run but yeah yeah i think i think it just shows its role in relation like and our role our role is connecting whatever exists with you know with what doesn't and then and then i think for your strategy like the website is hopefully then the strategic plan you know really clearly how we then finance it you know here are the five circles and how we're looking to finance it yeah government you can now make it punchier as well it's like for governments we're looking for people that want to like there it's there's a self what do i get back so yeah we're looking for five people that want to be the first to access the r\&d live from all this and apply for the r\&d and then we're looking for people that want to be the first to apply it and work with us as co-designers who are the five governments that want it you know and we've got space for five that we could go really deep with we're looking for five families that want to influence the way organizations work and we want to share the intelligence we're looking for five impact partners that want us to be part of their r d lab so they can transfer on the way impact reports and you just cost them all a half mil to a million a year and we want to secure these all you know like um by june next year or whatever it might be and yeah um hoping sammy under this one or yeah sure go for it i'll have another maybe you can have a go at explaining it and i'll just make sure the comprehension goes you you Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. It's going. It's going. Good? It's going. Good to see you, mate. How are you, Jacko? Yep. Next question. What are we doing? Tell me about your circles, Jack. Ben, do you want to have a go explaining or do you want me to go again? I think you can go, but I think I'll do a little summary, I think, just to see how my head's going. I'm not going to be in a situation where I'm going with it all, but I think, like, where my head was going, like reading through that GDR stuff that you sent through, was to be able to understand from a strategic perspective, how are we showing the value? And I guess jumping down to the bottom section there, where you're like $1 trillion of planetary wealth, we need to, like, level up our understanding about what we're doing in imagination, in embassy, which is in the world. And, like, embassy is us actually having aimed staff and, like, aimed representatives activating real-world activities through, like, things that are creating the physical representation of the impact of hoodie economics and imagination. And then we have all these tools that are accessible that are either, like, active or ongoing. Where people understand, like, there's the practical things that you can pick up and can use yourself that then attaches itself to this $1 trillion of planetary wealth. But I think it's, like, the simplification of we've got an awesome place where people hang out, and that's where our relational health and understanding about what we're doing in imagination. And then we've got things that are happening in the real world where people are getting around in embassy. And then we have things that people can pick up and do. And then we have things that people can do as well. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Sammy, I was trying to expand. I was the, yeah, I think getting a sense of the, there's, like, a combination that you pulled out there, which is, like, part of what good strategy does for us is it understands, like, resource allocation of our time. Like, where does the team go? But also what's the impact and what's the, like, just how do we split our own attention? And then what's the most important thing? And then what's the most important, like, impact? You know, those pointy questions where someone's like, well, what do you want to change? You know, the, well, we aren't, we aren't unlock a trillion dollars worth of planetary health that's been untapped because it's been put outside the margins and no one's built a network to them. No one's built a network to nature. No one's built a network to all the people that have been marginalized. We've been doing it for 20 years. How are you applying it? Um, and through three different channels. And I think that's the key. Like, so, Sammy, I was just working on that, trying to work out what's the frame beyond imagination if someone's landing on the web for homepage of the website. And so I think through three different channels, well, we've got, we've got a digital country to be a live lab experiment for humanity, to show how we can actually apply relational economics in real time and activate 5,000 key people that can influence 10,000 people each, at least across different entities to create a relational, um, ecosystem around the world. And that's part one, the impact of their work will be significant as they reach out in their relational health to increase the wealth and, and quality of our life in all our different places around the world. Um, and that will directly affect, you know, 50 million on people within a generation. We've got a hundred system change projects with inside the digital country, which we're, um, accelerating, which have the capacity for universal change around the world on, on alleviating inequity and a hundred tools that were developed in this ecosystem. And then I was. Saying before, you know, that the part to really drag out. So we're not, so we can just say the obvious. I think we know that we've designed imagination to be a research and development nation state for all nations on earth. So we had the United nations developed 40 years ago. Imagination has been designed. So every country can see, we know that we've got flaws with GDP, but we haven't been able to apply in real time, something that can scale. So imagination will provide a case study for how we. Explore GRP gross relational potential or gross relational index, and look at how we apply these different areas. So in the space of impact and research and development on economic design for nation states, for governments or for state governments, for local councils, um, right through to organization, like you keep it in the government framework with imagination with that's why I've applied visas. It's why I've applied, created a reserve bank. It's why we're looking at, you know, GDP. We're looking at all the pathways. We're looking at all the different ways that we can move. So it can then be applied. And that's why we're inviting five key governments to be the key R and D partners with us and have access to developing this with us and working in real time and applying it in their local councils or countries and work with us to bring big story to their areas and really activate five nation states. So it's an imagination invitation for five countries to partner with it as a lab to improve every country on planet earth when they're gone. So that's sort of the top level. And then inside it. And then the bottom level is the five thousand key groups. You know, joy corp is a it's for a thousand joy corpse to improve, to then share the knowledge for every organization around the world, have the chance to capture the stuff that's missing. That gives us joy. That gives us our health, our relational health, and to integrate it, to move beyond the triple bottom line, which is one of the key phrases in finance reporting and to move to a place where we can capture the stuff that we don't capture in GDP. And we can do that from, um, I. That the, the corporate world. Can leave that, you know, the business and commerce can leave that. And then you have all these other spaces for entities to be able to help move this and solve some of these challenges, um, of the five groups, but you listen there. And then you look at embassy. And say, so there's imagination that we've created as digital country. That's one, one channel that we've created. The second one is we move in embassy. Um, we go out, you know, um, yeah, we've got a thousand imagination classrooms. You're trying to help build around the world. Over the course of a decade. We've got a reserve bank of dreams that we're working on developing for human kind with a thousand year dream project. Um, we've got. Uh, world of we're trying to unite the world of mentors, uh, three mentor magic and last week of school every year and create a mentor toolkit that's open for everybody around the world. Um, we're providing reminders, uh, to reclaim time after a pledge system to shift us to relational health, where people can pledge kindness and love. Um, and. Um, if you want to continue your Lance Silver's. Well, specifically, um, so let's get this out of the way here and give you a bit of an lacrimal at this. If you haven't already, just like a little reminder that there are reasons to support Claire Farrow's websitebewdery. rewarding bam. And I can't even clean up my words, so figured I'll just say this. Seriously, this is, just go buy some of our, our Lewis 삼宝inks and I'm just going to go ahead and run this one, send it. Thanks me to it's. All right. Good modifications to your, to, uh, an entity. That you have here to, to this right today. Hi, I'm notice Marlina Derman here from the UTI. Press 4. development to be released in 2025 game of life and development to be released in 2025 imagine development released in 2025 the professors develops and then released in 2025 one million presidents in development um to activate so you can still do the million kids but you just pull them into a tool shared playground and then you look at a nature fund that's in development you know to crack a nature-based um fund for humanity that can center a nature-based marketplace and then underneath aim not imagination so that's also the part which is dumb i'm fucking heading like which one goes first who are we so you say aim aim can unlock over a trillion dollars worth of planetary wealth for human fine and then inside imagination we can talk about the governance systems but then with aim we just have here's our board of directors here's our ceo here's here's how we run it you can have a really lame lean like people and then imagination can be have its own governance part embassy can have its own governance part and then in terms of who's responsible for the government and then you can have a really lean like people and then you can have an honest sky directory that's lime you can have ladies feet and lady feet and then you can have third wheel and there's like decomposition of that kind of like context right like in terms of steff you're responsible for imagination алеah you're responsible for embassy and yolanda you're responsible for tools when it comes to product management like these three women are responsible for this um but i think it yeah so that and then i And then you've got four key sections that you're looking at inside imagination. Is there's like, yeah, there's embassy. Embassy, you might have dinosaur trance. Yeah. You know, but I don't know if it stacks up, but it could sit there in the subtopics or whatever. Or you have the friends list or communication or whatever. That might be the same thing. But yeah, you've got like imagination, embassy, tools. And there's the three main headlines that you can see on the website and the three main things we're tracking in our impact. And then you've got, you know, communication, pretty economics and impact. Sort of below the line. Yeah. And then partner with us. And the partner piece, be one of the five governments that gets the first R\&D on how to crack open, GDP, wellbeing indexes, be in relation with nature, activate intelligence outside the margins, alleviate inequity. That's a strong proposition to a government. Yeah. I can take that to Oxford. You know, in embassy, like bring us to your city, bring us to your towns, like bring us to your schools. In tools, work with us on the development of this or, you know, to be an ecosystem partner where it can live in your ecosystem. We don't want it. We want to give it away to keep it. Yeah. It's getting close to that one pager that the world keeps asking for, isn't it? It's that big, you know, like it's not even a, it's on a fucking, it's even smaller than a one pager. I wrote it on a, whatever they're called, origami piece of paper. You can make big cranes and just float them out to the world, see where they end up. Mate, you can make that into a card that people can take around. Yeah. Like that's in terms of for our team, just hit like a little, yeah, little paper plane or a little like card in terms of giving it to people. That's communicated. You can communicate it all there. Yeah. And then the digital version, you just got all the, like the deeper links into, you know, how that one trillion is broken down. You can look more deeply at to the different tools. Yep. You can go through to imagination, get the tour. Yep. Yeah. It's like the entry point. Yeah. And we can make imagination a lot. Less invisible. Like at the moment, the actual platform is invisible too. So we can make that visible on a mentoring.com a bit more. So you can just get a sense of that and see the features and people can click through and see the opening, you know, see the webpage exists and look around on the outside and that can have its own little energy to it. But yeah, absolutely. I think like pretty much here in terms of like looking at our old website, it's a great thing. If you can delete a lot of words, you know, like it means that you're getting to a good place, but this is pretty much it. And the rest of it's just like putting the, the elements there of the design of it. It's like a funnel as well. Like the way I've like, since we started this new website process, Jack, like I think where my mind's always been going is like open source decentralized, right? Where all of the knowledge sits somewhere, but what we're doing was funneling this up to like a one pager. But at some point you can get to all that other knowledge. If you want to, like, if you dig hard enough. Yeah. And it doesn't, as long as we're not boxing ourselves into an existing framework, letting that's where I was like, you know, it's, it's fucked all this stuff. Like you have, you've got to go so full circle and understand that, but then you get, you get to come out. Yeah. So it's not the prophet, like the professors just at all. And so it ain't really saying anything about puppets and confused people about public. So you can just, but we've got, heaps written like pretty much that whole website is now just like explain the world, you know? Totally. And it helped us understand, you know, yesterday I did the professor's edit and they've got their world. Anyway, I'll leave that with you guys.

FAQs KIQs (Key Insight Questions)

\


How can you alleviate inequity that positively impact billions of human lives and millions of other species?

\


Our work is at the start of the systemic design queue. If one of the many bodies of research is applied at scale that will be a pathway to positively impacting billions of lives and millions of other species. For example:

* If a current social network applied our relational energy score to their network it could increate health of billions
* If 20% of governments over the next century built on our GRP (Gross Relational Potential) case study that could improve the lives of billions
* If we can solve the challenge of a nature centred marketplace that can improve the lives of millions of species
* If one of our current Systems Change Residents, who is working on harnessing the energy of the sun through plants for human energy supply is successful we could alleviate energy burden for all of human kind and take the pressure off all species via climate change.

\


This is just a sample of the examples of work, if JOY Corps are applied across all organisations as a impact scorecard it could reach billions and increase health of millions of species, if the tools are of use to human kind over the next century and beyond they could have value to hundreds of millions of people, and so on.

\


What has informed the design of the work? The creation of IMAGI-NATION?\


20 years of applying a theory of unlikely connections through systemic network design which has included work that:

* led to significant alleviation of educational inequity for one of the most marginalised groups in the world, Indigenous Australians, and increased intelligence for a generation of university students.&#x20;
* Built a global university free for all from all races and ages to organise change - and had students apply the work across 52 countries
* Helped support the founding of one of the world’s first if not first Indigenous knowledge systems labs
* Incubated nature impact research and intelligence \


Then the specific design of IMAGI-NATION included:

* Shaping a co-created story from scratch with 50+ leaders from inside and outside the margins, from Prime Ministers, to entrepreneurs in Uganda - which gifted us NIGHT in IMAGI-NATION the story.
* Deep rolling yarns of which all the research and insights and conversations are documented here
* The Publishing of a philosophical and economic text to underpin IMAGI-NATION - Hoodie Economics
* Governance and guidance from the Indigenous knowledge systems labs and a suite of mentors, guides, knowledge holders from inside and outside the margins
